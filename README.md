This README document steps necessary to get the application up and running.

# Run with Vagrant

You need to install Vagrant and VirtualBox.

Then run `vagrant up`. It will take a good time the first time.

After virtual machine(VM) is running run `vagrant ssh` to connect to it.

Then install dependencies, setup database and run Rails server with:

```shell
cd /vagrant
bundle
rake db:setup
rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```

On another terminal run `vagrant ssh` and run Redis inside VM with:

```shell
redis-server
```

On another terminal run `vagrant ssh` and run Sidekiq inside VM with:

```shell
cd /vagrant
sidekiq
```
